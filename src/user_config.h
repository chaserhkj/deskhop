 * defined as HID_KEY_<something>
 *
 * If you do not want to use a key for switching outputs, you may be tempted
 * to select HID_KEY_NONE here; don't do that! That code appears in many HID
 * messages and the result will be a non-functional keyboard. Instead, choose
 * a key that is unlikely to ever appear on a keyboard that you will use.
 * HID_KEY_F24 is probably a good choice as keyboards with 24 function keys
 * are rare.
